# Authentication
For Authentication I used UUID token which  I keep it in  a ConcurrentHashMap.
User get this token when he login and then in every call he should send it in his header call.


# Database
I used a mock database in order to be more easy to deploy.
But I used Jpa repository as I will do if I use a normal database more example how to connect to database there are in this project https://github.com/seintaridis/kinderplan-1
